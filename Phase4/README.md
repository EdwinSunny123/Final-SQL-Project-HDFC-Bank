# 🏦 HDFC Bank Database Project – Phase 4

## 📌 Overview
This project represents **Phase 4** of the **HDFC Bank Database System** built in MySQL.  
It focuses on **advanced database optimization and automation techniques** such as **Views, Indexes, Stored Procedures, and Triggers**.  

This phase builds on the schema (Phase 1), queries (Phase 2), and advanced querying (Phase 3), making the database **more efficient, secure, and practical for real-world use**.

  - `Loan_ID`  
  - `Branch_ID`  

---

### 🔹 3. Stored Procedures
- Automated **repetitive banking operations** with stored procedures.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Loan EMI calculation procedure  
  - Monthly balance interest update procedure  
  - Complaint escalation procedure  

---

### 🔹 4. Triggers
- Implemented **triggers for real-time automation**.  
- **Examples:**
