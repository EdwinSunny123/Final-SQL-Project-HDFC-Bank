1. **Views**
   - Created views for simplified reporting.

   - Implemented triggers for real-time automation.  
   - Examples: Auto-update account balance after transactions, block expired cards, auto-log locker visits.

5. **Advanced Queries**
   - Analytical queries combining multiple tables for:  
     - Customer profitability analysis
