# 🏦 HDFC Bank Database Project – MySQL

> A complete, realistic MySQL database simulating core banking operations — built for learning, analysis, and portfolio showcase.

---

# 📘 Overview
This repository contains a full MySQL-based banking database: schema design, populated tables, and comprehensive SQL scripts that demonstrate real-world banking workflows, automation, and analytics.

---

# 💡 Why this Project Matters
- Strengthens hands-on **SQL** and **relational database** skills.  
- Shows real-world **data modeling**, **constraints**, and **transactional workflows**.  
- Great for **academic projects**, interviews, and portfolio demonstrations.  
- Enables building analytics and reporting pipelines on top of structured banking data.

# 🧱 Core Database Structure
- **Customers** — personal & contact details.  
- **Accounts** — account numbers, types, balances, branch mapping.  
- **Transactions** — debit/credit logs with timestamps and narrations.  
- **Loans** — loan accounts, amounts, interest, tenure, status.  
- **Branches** — branch metadata and managers.  
- **FixedDeposits** — FD records, start/end dates, interest.  
- **UPI_Transactions** — digital payments and counterparty info.  
- **Mobile_Banking** — app activity logs and authorizations.  
- **Bill_Payments** — utility & merchant payment records.  
- **Customer_Feedback** — ratings, comments, and issue tags.

# 🚀 Project Phases (one-liners)
- **Phase 1 — Database creation, table creation & values**  
  Created the database, defined schemas, and populated realistic Indian-context records.  

- **Phase 2 — DDL, DML, DQL, constraints, clauses & operators**  
  Implemented schema changes, inserts/updates/deletes, select queries, data constraints, clauses and SQL operators.  

- **Phase 3 — Joins, subqueries & functions**  
  Built complex joins, nested queries, and reusable SQL functions for business logic.  

- **Phase 4 — Triggers, views, CTEs, window functions, stored procedures, etc.**  
  Added automation, logical views, modular queries, advanced analytics with windowing, and stored routines.  

- **Phase 5 — Real-world scenario & ~100 queries covering all SQL concepts**  
  End-to-end scenarios with nearly 100 curated queries that exercise and validate all major SQL topics.

---

# 🧠 Learning Outcomes
- Design and normalize a multi-table relational schema.  
- Apply constraints, indexes, and best practices for data integrity.  
- Write efficient, real-world SQL (joins, subqueries, CTEs, window funcs).  
- Automate behavior via triggers and stored procedures.  
- Produce analytical reports and business insights from transactional data.

---

# 🧾 Typical Use Cases
- **Students**: practice and demonstrate SQL competencies.  
- **Developers**: use as a backend schema for fintech prototypes.  
- **Analysts**: explore joins, aggregates, and reporting scenarios.  
- **Interview prep**: walk through real queries & DB design discussion.
