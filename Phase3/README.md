# 🏦 HDFC Bank Database Project – Phase 3

## 📌 Overview
This project represents **Phase 3** of the **HDFC Bank Database System** built in MySQL.  
It focuses on applying **Joins, Subqueries, and Different Types of SQL Functions (including User-Defined Functions)** on the schema and data created in **Phase 1** and **Phase 2**.  

The main goal is to generate **analytical reports** and practice **advanced SQL querying techniques** in the context of banking operations.

## 🗂️ Concepts Practiced

### 🔹 1. Joins
- Applied `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN` across multiple tables.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Fetch customer details with their **account type, branch, and last transaction**.  
  - List employees working in **branches with more than 50 active accounts**.  
  - Retrieve loan details with **linked customer and guarantor information**.  

---

### 🔹 2. Subqueries
- Implemented both **single-row** and **multi-row** subqueries.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Identify customers who have **loans greater than the average loan amount**.  
  - Find employees who **earn more than their branch’s average salary**.  
  - Retrieve accounts with **transactions above the bank’s overall average transaction amount**.  

---

### 🔹 3. Functions
- Used a mix of **built-in SQL functions** (string, date, numeric) and **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Function to **classify customers by credit score** (Excellent, Good, Average, Poor).  
  - Function to **calculate the age group of customers** (Youth, Adult, Senior).  
  - Function to **compute EMI amount** based on loan principal, rate, and tenure.
