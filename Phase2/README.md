# HDFC Bank Database Project – Phase 2

## 📌 Overview
This project is part of a larger **HDFC Bank Database System** built in MySQL.  
The **Phase-2.sql** script focuses on practicing **DDL, DML, DQL, Clauses, Constraints, and Operators**.  

It demonstrates **real-world banking operations** through queries applied to various entities such as **Customers, Branches, Accounts, Transactions, Employees, Loans, Cards, ATMs, Cheques, Deposits, Online Banking, KYC, Complaints, Insurance, and more**.
