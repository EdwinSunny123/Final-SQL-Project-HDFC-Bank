# üè¶ HDFC Bank Database Project ‚Äì Phase 5

## üìå Overview
This project represents **Phase 5** of the **HDFC Bank Database System** built in MySQL.  
It focuses on **enterprise-level database features** like **Views, Stored Procedures, Cursors, Triggers, Window Functions, DCL & TCL operations, and User Management**.  

This phase ensures the database is **optimized, automated, and secure**, simulating real-world banking operations.

## üóÇÔ∏è Concepts Practiced
1. **Views**
   - Created multiple reporting views (e.g., high-value loans, active accounts, debit transactions, employee salary reports).  

2. **Stored Procedures**
   - Automated tasks such as fetching records, counting/grouping, salary summaries, transaction reports, etc.  

3. **Cursors**
   - Implemented cursors to iterate through datasets (e.g., senior citizens, bounced cheques, NEFT transactions).  

4. **Triggers**
   - Used triggers for automation and data integrity:  
     - Prevent duplicates (Aadhaar, IFSC, Cheque No, Card No).  
     - Auto-update balances and statuses.  
     - Log changes (emails, managers, account balances).  

5. **Window Functions**
   - Applied `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `SUM() OVER`, `COUNT() OVER` for analytics.  

6. **Transactions (TCL)**
   - Practiced `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK` for safe financial operations.  

7. **Data Control (DCL) & User Management**
   - Created users (`analyst`, `branchuser`, `accuser`, `txnuser`, `empuser`, etc.).  
   - Granted and revoked privileges to enforce access control.
